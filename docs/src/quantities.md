# Quantities

Quantities are numerical values computed during training and logged for
visualization.

## Implemented quantities

### Loss
The training loss measures how well the model fits the data.

### Gradient norm
The gradient norm summarizes the magnitude of gradients across model parameters
and helps detect optimization instabilities.

## Planned quantities

Future work includes adding quantities such as curvature-related metrics and
per-layer statistics, inspired by the cockpit paper.
